## Cohomology projects

1) Brauer groups
2) The Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence
3) Profinite group cohomology
4) Definition of Tate-Shaferevich group of an elliptic curve over Q
5) Triangulated categories and derived categories
6) Show that abelian sheaves on any site have enough injectives
7) Balancing Tor

## Details of cohomology projects

1) Let K be a field. The goal is to write down isomorphisms between the following three
gadgets: (a) Morita equivalence classes of central simple algebras over K, with addition
given by tensor product (b) A "concrete H^2" of ...

## Other stuff

Define category of Lie algebras and category of Lie modules over a Lie algebra. Get as far as cohomology

Define root systems. Prove the basics.

Define composition algebras. Define their Lie algebra of skew-adjoint derivations. Hence g2. Note: I don't understand this

Define Jordan algebras. Exotic but fun. Can be used to define bigger exceptional Lie algebras, groups.

  * Define Lie derivations. Can we make these a generalisation of our existing definition of derivations for modules over a commutative ring? Would this require a `to_lie` decorated invoking some meta logic like `to_additive`?

* Define morphisms of Lie modules over different Lie algebras.

* Existence of Cartan subalgebras and uniqueness up to conjugation.

* Missing results about radical of a Lie algebra which show equivalence of various definitions of being reductive in char 0 (r(I) = I ⊓ r and ⁅⊤, ⊤⁆ ⊓ r = ⁅⊤, r⁆ and so ⁅⊤, ⊤⁆ semisimple iff reductive)



    Can do anything to push forward our analysis, especially complex analysis?

Can we define the Gaussian hypergeometric series? Follow on work would be the analytic continuation, its role as solution to corresponding hypergeometric ODE. A lot of things can be defined in terms of it (or more general hypergeometric series).

Schwarzian derivative? Characterisation in terms of Mobius transformations. [No application in mind, I just like it.]

Define the Pfaffian, prove invariant under conjugation action of orthogonal group. Follow up work on general invariant polynomials. [Eventual application to define Euler density, integrates to Euler characteristic.]


Anything on invariant theory? Can we prove k{V]^G finitely generated for V a fin dim rep of finite group G?

Define Shannon capacity of a graph? I don't really know this theory so not sure what should be first thing to prove but I like the idea, especially as graph theory people seem to be showing up a bit more frequently.

Do we have the Hausdorff measure?

For what it's worth the above is what's left after weeding out all the things I think are blocked by lack of more foundational stuff. I think the two most common things I wanted to be able to say were "Let V be a projective variety" and "Let M be Riemannian manifold".
