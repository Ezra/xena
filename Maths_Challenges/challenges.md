## Maths challenges for the Lean curious

If you have played through the [natural number game](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/) and are wondering what other mathematics can be done in Lean, you might want to try some of these challenges. I will try and post around one per week.

Challenge 1: [the composite of injective functions is injective](https://tinyurl.com/LeanMathsChallenge01). Here's [the solution](https://tinyurl.com/LeanMathsChallengeSolution01).

Challenge 2: coming on or before 15th Dec (pester me on Twitter if you want it before then, it's already written)


### Stuck?

If you don't want to look at the solution but have questions, you can ask questions in the `#new members` stream on the [Lean Zulip Chat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members) (login required, real names preferred, be nice).
