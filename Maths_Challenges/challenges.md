## Maths challenges for the Lean curious

If you have played through the [natural number game](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/) and are wondering what other mathematics can be done in Lean, you might want to try some of these challenges. I will try and post a few per week.

Challenge 1 (9/12/19): [the composite of injective functions is injective](https://tinyurl.com/LeanMathsChallenge01). There's [hints](https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/blob/master/Maths_Challenges/hints/challenge01.md) and [the solution](https://tinyurl.com/LeanMathsChallengeSolution01).

Challenge 2 (12/12/19): [a set of reals has at most one supremum](https://tinyurl.com/leanmathschallenge002). There's [hints](https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/blob/master/Maths_Challenges/hints/challenge02.md) and [the solution](https://tinyurl.com/leanmathschallengesolution002).

### Stuck?

If you don't want to look at the solution but have questions, you can ask questions in the `#new members` stream on the [Lean Zulip Chat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members) (login required, real names preferred, be nice).

If you want to see lots of solutions, check out [this directory](https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/tree/master/Maths_Challenges/solutions), where I have been uploading variants which people mention on the chat.
