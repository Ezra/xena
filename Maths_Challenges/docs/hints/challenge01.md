# Hints for challenge 1.

`unfold injective` might help; `unfold injective at hf` also works.

You can use `intro a` to make progress on a goal which starts `âˆ€ a, ...`. This translates to "let `a` be an arbitrary element of (whatever)".

I try to explain `apply` in Proposition World in the natural number game, but some people find it hard.
