# Hints for challenge 8.

This came up in the course I'm teaching this term.
Recall that `set.subset.antisymm` is the theorem
that if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A then A = B. If you also
prove (𝕀 (𝕍 (𝕀 W))) = 𝕀 W (and the proof is the same
as the challenge of course) then you can deduce that
the images of 𝕍 and 𝕀 biject with each other, which
looks a bit like the Nullstellensatz in the context
we're in, in my course. Why is it not the Nullstellensatz?
