# Affine algebraic sets

This file defines affine algebraic subsets of affine n-space and proves basic properties
about them.

## Important definitions

* `affine_algebraic_set k` -- the type of affine algebraic sets over the field `k`.

## Notation

None as yet -- do we need 𝔸ⁿ for affine n-space?

## Implementation notes

Much, but not all, of this file assumes that `k` is algebraically closed.
Remark: analysis/complex/polynomial.lean contains proof that ℂ is alg closed.

The union of two algebraic sets is an algebraic set.

# The union of two affine algebraic sets is an affine algebraic set.

Let k be a field and let n be a natural number. We prove the following
theorem in this file:

Theorem. If V and W are two affine algebraic subsets of kⁿ
then their union V ∪ W is also an affine algebraic subset of kⁿ.

Maths proof: if V is cut out by the set S ⊆ k[X_1,X_2,…,X_n]
and W is cut out by T, then we claim V ∪ W is cut out by the set ST := { s*t | s ∈ S and t ∈ T}.
To prove that the set cut out by ST equals V ∪ W, we prove both inclusions separately.

One inclusion is very easy. If x ∈ V ∪ W then either every element of S vanishes at x or every
element of T vanishes on x, and either way every element of ST vanishes at x.

Conversely, if x vanishes at every element of ST, then we want to prove that x ∈ V ∪ W. If x is
in V then we're done. If not, then this means that there exists some s ∈ S with s(x) ≠ 0. 
Then for every t ∈ T, we have s(x)t(x)=st(x)=0, and hence t(x)=0, which implies that x is in W.

In Lean the type of `union` is this:

`def union (V W : affine_algebraic_set k n) : affine_algebraic_set k n`

## Implementation notes

I defined an affine algebraic set to be the zeros of an arbitrary
set of functions, as opposed to just a finite set. We will see later
on that these definitions are equivalent.

If V is an affine algebraic set, then V is a pair. The first
element of the pair is a subset V.carrier ⊆ kⁿ, but we will call this set V as well (there is
a coercion from affine algebraic sets to subsets of kⁿ).
The second element of the pair is the proof that there exists a subset S of k[X_1,X_2,...,X_n]
such that V is cut out by S, by which I mean that V is the set of x ∈ k^n which vanish
at each element of S.
