## Cohomology projects

The seven goals:

1) Brauer groups
2) The Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence
3) Profinite group cohomology
4) Definition of Tate-Shaferevich group of an elliptic curve over Q
5) Triangulated categories and derived categories
6) Show that abelian sheaves on any site have enough injectives
7) Balancing Tor

The goals are in fact precisely-defined; see below.


## Details of the projects

1) Let K be a field. The goal is to write down isomorphisms between the following three
gadgets: (a) Morita equivalence classes of central simple algebras over K, with addition
given by tensor product (b) A "concrete H^2" of
