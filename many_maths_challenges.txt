------------------------------------

Also some chores (from Chris Hughes)

- zmod - requiring a pnat is a superfluous assumption, it should be refactored so we can quotient by zero. Also, zmodp should take a nat.primes and not a hypothesis hp : p.prime so there is no need for two types.

- GCD domain - Currently integrated with normalisation domain, but there should be a version without this since there are GCD domains that do not have a normalisation function. Maybe GCD domains are just pointless though. [KB indeed can't (yet) see the point of these things]

- Bundled Homs - refactor ideals, subgroups etc to use bundled Homs.

- mv polynomials - degree lemmas, integral domain etc, everything relevant on polynomials should be done for mv polynomials.

- finset.Icc, list.Icc, finset.Ioc etc.
