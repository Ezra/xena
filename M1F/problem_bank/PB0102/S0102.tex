(PB0102) It is true that $R$ implies~$P$. Here's why. Let's assume~$R$ is true (with the goal of trying to deduce that~$P$ is true). Can~$Q$ be false? No! For if~$Q$ is false then we know from the question that~$R$ will also be false, but we're assuming~$R$ is true. So~$Q$ must be true as well. And then again from the question, $P$ must be true. So if~$R$ is true then~$P$ is true too.
