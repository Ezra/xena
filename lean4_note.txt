To run Lean 4 on my laptop:

1) Make sure the line

if [ -e /home/buzzard/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh ]; then . /home/buzzard/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh; fi # added by Nix installer

ran at some point (or else you won't have nix-shell)

2) cd to ~/Kha/macro-supplement

3) nix-shell -A lean

4) emacs test.lean
